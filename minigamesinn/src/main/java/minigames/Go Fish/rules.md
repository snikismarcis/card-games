## How to Play

* Player who starts asks the opponent weather they have X value card in their hands. "Do you have any sevens?"
    * If the opponent does -> give the asking player all cards of the value. Asking player goes again.
    * If the opponent does not -> he says "Go fish!" and asking player draws a card from the deck.
